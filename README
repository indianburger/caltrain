Downloading tweets (doesn't not require node):
|sh getTweets.sh

- This will create a folder called tweetData where tweets are spread across files, 200 each.

Converting google transit file spec into a file with just the contents we need (requires node and npm)

Install node http://nodejs.org/#download
Install npm http://npmjs.org/

Go into node folder. run
|npm install
If I have specified the dependencies right, this is all you need to do. If not, you will see a "xxx module not found". In that case you can do a "npm install xxx" (but report it so I can fix package.json)
Now run
|node processGTFS.js
You will get a HUGE data file called stationKey.json. If you have textmate, open the file and see textmate struggle.
